title: "AI for Social Impact: Deployed Resource Optimization and Future Acceleration with Foundation Models"
abstract: "For nearly two decades, my team's work on AI for social impact (AI4SI) has focused on optimizing limited resources in public health, conservation, public safety, and other critical areas. I will highlight recent results from our deployed work in India on using bandit algorithms to improve effectiveness of  the world's two largest mobile health programs for maternal and child care that have served millions of beneficiaries. Additionally, I will briefly discuss our previous work on influence maximization for HIV prevention among youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Deploying end-to-end AI4SI systems pipeline requires us to repeat three steps of understanding stakeholdersâ€™ resource allocation challenges, building a tailored model and testing in the field. I'll share initial results on how we can leverage foundation models and LLMs to dramatically accelerate this AI4SI process."
