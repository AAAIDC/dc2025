title: "AI for Social Impact: Deployed Resource Optimization and Future Acceleration with Foundation Models"
abstract: "For nearly two decades, my team&rsquo;s work on AI for social impact (AI4SI) has focused on optimizing limited resources in public health, conservation, public safety, and other critical areas. I will highlight recent results from our deployed work in India on using bandit algorithms to improve effectiveness of  the world&rsquo;s two largest mobile health programs for maternal and child care that have served millions of beneficiaries. Additionally, I will briefly discuss our previous work on influence maximization for HIV prevention among youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Deploying  end-to-end AI4SI systems  pipeline requires us to repeat three steps of understanding stakeholdersâ€™ resource allocation challenges, building a tailored model and testing in the field. I&rsquo;ll share initial results on how we can leverage foundation models and LLMs to dramatically accelerate this AI4SI process."
